# fsx-interactives

Small programs, utilities, experiments or prototypes etc. in fsharp to be run primarily with `fsi` (fsharp interactive - the repl tool). Lightweight enough to avoid using a .NET(core) project skeleton such as maybe generated by the [netcore skeleton](https://github.com/enerqi/fsharp-netcore-skeleton) script.

Some fsx programs may require `.paket/paket.exe install` to be run to fetch dependencies.
